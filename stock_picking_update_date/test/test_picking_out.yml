  I create a picking with two lines with different expected dates.  I choose
  dates in the past to avoid the test outcome to change in the future.
-
  !record {model: stock.picking.out, id: picking_3}:
-
  !record {model: stock.move, id: picking_3_line_1}:
    picking_id: picking_3
    date_expected: 2013-11-01
    product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
    name: line1
    product_id: product.product_product_11
-
  !record {model: stock.move, id: picking_3_line_2}:
    picking_id: picking_3
    date_expected: 2013-11-03
    product_uom: product.product_uom_unit
    name: line2
    product_id: product.product_product_12
-
  I now use the new date_expected field of the picking.
-
  !record {model: stock.picking.out, id: picking_3}:
    date_expected: 2013-10-07
-
  I check that the expected dates of the two moves have changed.
-
  !assert {model: stock.move, id: picking_3_line_1}:
    - date_expected == '2013-10-07 00:00:00'
-
  !assert {model: stock.move, id: picking_3_line_2}:
    - date_expected == '2013-10-07 00:00:00'
